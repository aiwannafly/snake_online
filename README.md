# Snake Online
It is a simple snake online game implemented with use of the `Flutter` framework and `Dart` language,
which uses **UDP** unicast and multicast messages for communicating between players.

The rules and the game protocol are described well here: https://gitlab.ccfit.nsu.ru/vadipp/04_snakes_task.
